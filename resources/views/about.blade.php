    <p> I'm p♥ssionate about all things technology! 
        I love diving into new software, designing creative projects, 
        and exploring the digital world. In my free time, you can find me 
        indulging in hobbies like gaming, music, baking, and lending a helping hand wherever I can. 
        The rainy weather—it's my favorite! 
        I'm fascinated by the power of water and storms, and I hold a deep respect for the vastness of the sea."
